					<h3>My hobbies and interest:</h3> 
					<p>I enjoy doing sports as one of my hobby. During my free days, i would prefer to go out to be active instead of just sitting at home. Some examples of different types of sports i did was: hiking, ice skating and inline skating. </p>
					<p>I took up many different sports since young. I joined a swimming club when i was in primary school and continued to take up netball as a sports cca in my secondary school. </p>
					<p>I enjoyed both of those sports but i wanted to venture out to try different sports, so in Singapore polytechnic, i decided to join Singapore Polytechnic's silat club as my cca as i didnt get a chance to try martial arts in my life. </p>

					<h3>Diploma in Landscape Architecture</h3> 
					<p>Apart from my hobbies and interest, i also enjoy drawing and doing some art during my free time. Through out my years of drawing different type of things, varying from portrait, fast sketch and doodling, i realise that i enjoy painting landscapes. I enjoy how nature and buildings come together to create a beautiful landscape. </p>
					<p>With that, i found out that Singapore Polytechnic offers a course which is of my interest. Therefore, i did whatever it takes to enter this course and i got it! :D </p>
					<p>The pictures shown below is my model for my final project that i did during for my final year project in year 1. </p>
